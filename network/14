# 14. What file contains the local DNS entries?

# /etc
# """
# This is the nerve center of your system, it contains all system related
# configuration files in here or in its sub-directories. A "configuration file"
# is defined as a local file used to control the operation of a program; it
# must be static and cannot be an executable binary. For this reason, it's a
# good idea to backup this directory regularly. It will definitely save you a
# lot of re-configuration later if you re-install or lose your current
# installation. Normally, no binaries should be or are located here.
# """
# /etc/hosts
# """
# This file is used to define a system name and domain combination with a
# specific IP address. This file needs to always contain an entry for an IP
# address, if the machine is connected to the network.

# According to the linux documentation project, we should find the file
# containing the IP address information to be located in /etc/resolv.config
# since this is true for osx as well, we'd expect the same answer will apply.

/etc/hosts
