# must be static and cannot be an executable binary. For this reason, it's a
# good idea to backup this directory regularly. It will definitely save you a
# lot of re-configuration later if you re-install or lose your current

# Configuration of how DNS is to occur is defined in this file.
# It tells the name resolver libraries where they need to go to find
# information not found in the /etc/hosts file. This always has at least one
# nameserver line, but preferably three. The resolver uses each in turn.
# More than the first three can be included but anything beyond the first
# three will be ignored. Two lines that appear in the /etc/resolv.conf file
# are domain and search. Both of these are mutually exclusive options, and
# where both show up, the last one wins. Other entries beyond the three
# discussed here are listed in the man pages but aren't often used.
