# 15. Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# to make the intra address reroute to a different ip address, all that is
# necessary is to edit the /etc/hosts file with the ip addresss of the site
# you'd like to be routed to instead - so something like this would suffice:

s/#10.51.1.38/46.19.122.85/
